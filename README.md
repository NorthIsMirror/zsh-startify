# zsh-startify

A plugin that aims at providing what
[vim-startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify) plugin does, but in Zsh. The
analogy isn't fully easy to make. `vim-startify` states:

> It provides dynamically created headers or footers and uses configurable lists to
> show recently used or bookmarked files and persistent sessions.

zsh-startify:
 - shows recently used files,
 - shows recently used vim files,
 - will show active tmux sessions,
 - will show statistics of most popular aliases in use,
 - will show recently visited projects (i.e. `git` repositories, but also directories
   with a `Makefile`, a `CMakeLists.txt`, a `configure` script, etc. â€“ a very advanced
   feature, inherited from `zsh-startify`'s predecessor: `psprint/zaccumulator` plugin),
 - will show recently ran `git` commands, with analysis of e.g. recently checked-out
   branches.
